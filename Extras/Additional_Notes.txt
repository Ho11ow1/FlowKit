■ FlowKit - Additional Documentation
================================

■ Performance Guidelines
----------------------
○ Use coroutines for repetitive group operations
○ Use queues for complex single-element sequences
○ Simple animations that require 1 to 3 method calls can be directly invoked within a function
○ Although the library is lightweight, avoid running too many animations simultaneously

■ Common Patterns
--------------
○ Menu transitions
○ Loading sequences
○ Notification popups

■ Troubleshooting
--------------
○ "Animation not playing?":
  ・ Is the UI panel with [FlowKitEngine] active?
  ・ Is the target UI element (Button, Text, etc.) present in the hierarchy?
  ・ Are you using the correct occurrence number? (1st button = occurrence 1, not 0)
  ・ Check the [Console] for any error messages
○ Performance Tips:
 ・ Avoid animating the [Canvas] directly (expensive) 
 ・ Instead, animate a dedicated [UI panel] as intended
